# Debugging

If JTFRAME_RELEASE is not defined, the debug features can be used.

## GFX Enable Bus

keys F7-F10 will toggle bits in the gfx_en bus. After reset all bits are high. These bits are meant to be used to enable/disable graphic layers.

## Generic 8-bit Debug bus

If JTFRAME_DEBUG is defined, keys + and - (in a Spanish keyboard layout) will increase and decrease the 8-bit debug_bus.

By default, debug_bus is increased (decreased) by 1. If SHIFT is pressed with +/-, then the step is 16 instead. This can be used to control different signals with each debug_bus nibble. However, the bus is always increased as a byte, so be aware of it.

The game module must define the debug_bus input if JTFRAME_DEBUG is used.

## Generic SDRAM Dump

The SDRAM bank0 can be partially shadowed in BRAM and download as NVRAM via the NVRAM interface. This requires the macros JTFRAME_SHADOW and JTFRAME_SHADOW_LEN to be defined. The MRA file should also enable NVRAM with a statement such as:

```
<nvram index="2" size="1024"/>
```

It is not possible to use JTFRAME_SHADOW and JTFRAME_IOCTL_RD at the same time.
