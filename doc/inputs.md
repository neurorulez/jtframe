# Joysticks

By default JTFRAME supports two joysticks only and will try to connect to game modules based on this assumption. For games that need four joysticks, define the macro **JTFRAME_4PLAYERS**.
Note that the registers containing the coin and start button inputs are always passed as 4 bits, but the game can just ignore the 2 MSB if it only supports two players.

Analog controllers are not connected to the game module by default. In order to get them connected, define the macro **JTFRAME_ANALOG** and then these input ports:

```
input   [15:0]  joyana1,
input   [15:0]  joyana2,
```

Support for 4-way joysticks (instead of 8-way joysticks) is enabled by setting high bit 1 of core_mod. See MOD BYTE.

## Autofire

It is not encouraged to provide a generic autofire option as it alters the gameplay. But, for some games that used a spinner (like Heavy Barrel), it helps controlling the character. By defining **JTFRAME_AUTOFIRE0** an option will appear on the OSD to enable autofire only for the first button (joystick bit 4). The autofire is triggered every 8 frames.

# Trackball

The popular upd4701 is modelled in [jt4701](../hdl/keyboard/jt4701.v). The main module **jt4701** represents the original chip and should work correctly when connected to a trackball. There are two helper modules: jt4701_dialemu and jt4701_dialemu_2axis.

The trackball only measures differences in position from a reset event. Games often reset the count and because of that, the trackball cannot be easily replaced by an absolute value.

## jt4701_dialemu

Use to emulate trackball inputs with buttons. One button is used to increase the axis, and the other to decrease it. A rather slow clock is used at the *pulse* input to set the update rate. This emulator is meant to be hooked to the **jt4701** when no real trackball is present.

## jt4701_dialemu_2axis

A more comprehensive trackball emulator that already instantiates internally the **jt4701** and can be easily interface with the CPU.
